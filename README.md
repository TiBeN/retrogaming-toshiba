15Khz system for Toshiba Laptop
===============================

Personal project. Purpose is to build a "ready to inject" ISO image with an Archlinux
system with retroarch and arcademode to transform an old laptop to a retrogaming machine connected to a 15khz CRT monitor.

The main experiment here is to build entirely the os through a docker build.
